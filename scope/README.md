FUNCTIONS:
---------
1.c: we can consider static as function declaration
2.c: we cannot considet perameters as static, because static variables stored in data and variables stored in stack so no connection between variables;
3.c: we cannot consider all static perameters and function data type as static that leads to storage class specifier error  
4.c: we can take static as function datatype and variables instde main as static.
STRUCTURES:
-----------
1s.c: we canot take static,const,auto inside structure as structure member.
2s.c: we can take structure as static datatype.
3s.c: ??????????????????????????????????.
